# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)

    body: "If you‚Äôre building a modern Rails app in 2024, you‚Äôve probably heard of Hotwire ‚Äî a game-changing combo of Turbo + Stimulus that gives you reactive frontend experiences *without* writing JavaScript-heavy code.

Pair that with Action Text, Rails‚Äô built-in rich text editor (powered by Trix), and you‚Äôve got everything you need to build dynamic content-driven apps with minimal friction.

üß† What Is Hotwire?

Hotwire stands for HTML Over The Wire ‚Äî a modern approach where your Rails server sends HTML fragments over the wire instead of JSON. That means lightning-fast UX without the need for React or Vue.

Hotwire includes:
- Turbo ‚Äì handles navigation, form submissions, and partial updates.
- Stimulus ‚Äì adds light JavaScript behavior when needed.
- Turbo Streams ‚Äì push real-time updates to the browser via websockets or polling.

üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Hotwire in Rails

If you created your app like this:

  rails new myapp -j esbuild

Then Turbo and Stimulus are already wired up.

Otherwise, install it manually:

  bundle add hotwire-rails
  bin/rails hotwire:install

‚úçÔ∏è Adding Action Text

To enable rich text (like this!), install Action Text:

  bin/rails action_text:install
  bin/rails db:migrate

Now you can use Trix-based editors and attach images/files out of the box.
